The Backup Button allows you to copy the downloaded images to where ever you choose.
I kept the UI very simple by default it will always search for 100 results which is the maximum amount per search.

You can adjust autoplay speed with the slider it ranges from 0.5 to 10s.

I did not test this on any VM or a new PC so let me know if you encounter any issues.

As a programmer, I understand that some antivirus programs might flag this application as a potential threat. 
This is because the program performs actions that are commonly associated with malicious software, such as:

1. **Downloading Files**: The application downloads images from the internet, which can be seen as suspicious behavior by antivirus software.
2. **Opening Files**: The program opens downloaded images using system commands (`os.system`), which can be misinterpreted as an attempt to execute malicious code.
3. **File Operations**: The application reads, writes, and copies files on your system, which is a common behavior of malware.

However, I assure you that this program is not a virus. 
It is designed to download and display images from Gelbooru based on user-specified tags and an API key. 
The actions it performs are necessary for its functionality and are not harmful to your system. 
The source code is available for review, and you can see that it does not contain any malicious code.

By using any of my programs, you assume full responsibility for any potential negative outcomes.
